1. Installation

1.1 Compiling and Loading FFI

    (load "/path/to/mac-types/defsys.lisp")
    (compile-system 'mac-types)
    (load-system 'mac-types)

    At this point the basic type definitions should be in place. Basic
    conversion routines for the 64bit integer will work.

1.2 Compiling and Loading C support code (optional)

    % cd /path/to/mac-types
    % make
 
    This should compile the C support code for 64bit integer
    manipulation into 'mac-types-support.bundle'. This bundle contians
    trivial wrappers to allow manipulation of 64bit integers by
    reference from LispWorks converting them.

    (fli:register-module
    "/full/path/to/mac-types/mac-types-support.bundle)

2. Test

Very limited testing on the conversion routines for the UnsignedWide,
UInt64, and bignum/fixnum data. There are known signed/unsigned bugs
which need to be taken care of.
